## 🌟 Features

### 🎯 Landing Page

Imagine a digital launchpad that introduces the "US Nationwide Game-a-Thon" event and draws users to participate. That's what this landing page does! The design is not only visually appealing but also user-friendly, guiding visitors towards a clear call-to-action (CTA): the 'Sign Up Now' button. What's more? The layout is fully responsive, delivering a consistent experience across different devices.

### 📝 Modal Form

Click on the 'Sign Up Now' button, and voila! A comprehensive registration form pops up in a modal format. This form, while capturing the necessary participant details, ensures to keep the user experience smooth with an 'X' icon to close the modal easily.

### 🔒 Form Validation

To maintain data integrity and ensure we gather the right information, the form is equipped with custom validation rules:

- **First Name & Last Name**: Must be at least 2 characters and cannot be left empty.
- **Email**: A valid email address is required.
- **Number of Tournaments**: Users should indicate the number of tournaments they have attended.
- **Location**: One option must be selected from the provided locations.
- **Terms and Conditions**: To proceed, users need to agree to the terms and conditions. An additional checkbox is optional, allowing users to sign up for notifications about future events.

In case of validation failure upon form submission, the user is guided with relevant error messages displayed beneath the respective fields. A successful validation culminates in a warm confirmation message thanking the user for their submission.

## 💡 Technologies Used
